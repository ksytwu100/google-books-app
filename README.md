## Google Books Application

# Description

This challenge takes a functioning Google Books API search engine, the website URL is https://books.google.com/ that is built with a RESTful API and refactor it to be a Grahl API built with Apollo Server. This app was built by using MERN stack, it has a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. This app was built by using MERN stack, it has a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to search books, save books.

The assignment is for the students to do the following:

1. An Apollo Server to be set up to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.
2. The existing authentication middleware needs to be modified so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.
3. Create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.
4. Deploy the application to Render.

# Questions

When the GitHub profile (https://github.com/ksytwu100) is provided, that is added to the section entitled Questions. The class module provided the fully functioning Google Books API search engine starter code in React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. The application was refactored with my understanding of the required materials by attending classes, BCS tutoring sessions, Google searches, and attending office hours for the solutions to my questions.
